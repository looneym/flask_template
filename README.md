# Flask Template 

I write a lot of Flask apps. I get tired of setting things up each time. This provides 
pretty much the bare minimum needed to get an app up and running. 

### Usage

- Clone repo and `cd` into it
- `virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `python app.py`
- Navigate to http://localhost:8888
- Write some code!
